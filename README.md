# Disaster Tweet Analyzer: Natural Language Processing for Crisis Communication 

Project Overview: 

During emergencies and natural disasters, social media platforms become crucial channels for real-time information exchange and crisis communication. This project focuses on leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets related to disasters and emergencies. By classifying tweets as either relevant to a disaster or not, the project aims to assist emergency responders and organizations in identifying critical information amidst the noise of social media. 

Objectives:
1. Develop a text classification system capable of identifying tweets relevant to disasters or emergencies.
2. Explore and implement state-of-the-art NLP techniques for tweet preprocessing and feature extraction.
3. Evaluate the performance of the classification models across different disaster scenarios and datasets.
4. Showcase the practical applications of NLP in crisis communication and emergency response.
5. Document the project methodology, findings, and recommendations for knowledge sharing and future research.
